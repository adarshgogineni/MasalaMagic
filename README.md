# Masala Magic

**Masala Magic** is a web application that helps you discover delicious Indian recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. Utilizing the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and generative AI, Masala Magic offers personalized recipe suggestions that make the most of your pantry.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models. In RAG, the model first retrieves relevant documents or information from a large corpus and then uses a generative model to produce a coherent response or output based on the retrieved information. This approach enhances the accuracy and relevance of the generated content.

## How Masala Magic Uses RAG

Masala Magic leverages a dataset of Indian recipes to provide precise recipe suggestions. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Ingredients:** You provide a list of ingredients you currently have.
2. **Retrieve Recipes:** Our RAG model searches through a comprehensive database of Indian recipes to find those that match your ingredients.
3. **Generate Suggestions:** The generative AI refines and presents the recipes that best fit your ingredients and preferences.

## Features

- **Ingredient-Based Recipe Search:** Enter the ingredients you have, and Masala Magic will generate a list of Indian recipes you can make.
- **Diverse Cuisine Options:** From traditional dishes to modern twists, explore a variety of Indian flavors.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for seamless recipe discovery.
